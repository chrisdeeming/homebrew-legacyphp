# Legacy PHP Homebrew tap
Due to the [unnecessarily restrictive stance](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/34739) of the homebrew-core contributors, certain PHP versions will drop off over the coming months and will no longer available.

This tap aims to make those versions available again.
